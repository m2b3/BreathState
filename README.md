# BreathState

BreathState: an open-source Android/iOS and PC app for breathing and heart-rate synchronization.

Project Description: While there are several commercial, closed-source apps to interface with breathing and heart-rate sensors (like SniffLogic and the Polar H10), as well as open-source software to interface with each of them separately, there is an acute need for open-source software to record from both sensors simultaneously and provide a large battery of metrics and algorithms operating on the two time-series. This software will use Bluetooth and/or USB to connect with the two sensors, will allow the study of autonomic nervous function, and will allow biofeedback protocols for mood and health intervention to be implemented via live tracking of breathing and heart-rate. Future work can interface with consumer EEG devices like the Muse.

This is a new project, that this GSoC contributor will start from scratch, with help and mentorship from us. We have had good success in the past with such an approach, with successful projects going on to second and third years for additional development, and contributors from one year joining in as mentors for the following year. A good proposal will answer the questions of what do you propose to do, why, how will you do it, why should you be the person doing it, and is it feasible that you can do it. Additional questions are welcome via Neurostars.
